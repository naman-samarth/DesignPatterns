# Singleton Pattern

Lets you ensure
that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

- Used for logging, thread pools, driver objects and caching.
- Used in core java classes like java.lang.RunTime etc.

### Applicability:
- When a class in your program should have just a single instance available to all clients; for example, a single database object shared by different parts of the program.
- When you need stricter control over global variables.
