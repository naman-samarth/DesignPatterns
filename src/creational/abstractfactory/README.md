# Abstract Factory Pattern

Lets you
produce families of related objects without specifying their
concrete classes.

### Applicability
- when your code needs to work with
  various families of related products, but you don’t want it to
  depend on the concrete classes of those products—they might
  be unknown beforehand, or you simply want to allow for future
  extensibility.
