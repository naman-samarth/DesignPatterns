# Builder Pattern
Lets you construct
complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

### Applicability

- to get rid of a “telescoping
  constructor”.
- when you want your code to be able to create different representations of some product (for example, stone and wooden houses).
- to construct Composite trees or other complex objects.
