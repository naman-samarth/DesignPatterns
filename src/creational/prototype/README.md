# Prototype Pattern

Lets you copy
existing objects without making your code dependent on
their classes.

### Applicability 
- When your code should not depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.
- When you want to reduce the number of subclasses that only differ in the way they initialize their respective objects.
