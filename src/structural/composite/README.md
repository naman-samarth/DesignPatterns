# Composite Pattern
Used mainly for the cases when objects form a tree-like hierarchy. In this hierarchy, each node is either a composite or a leaf node.

- Provides 2 basic element types which share common interface: simple leaves & complex containers. These containers can further contain simple leaves & more containers making this a tree structre.
- Using this pattern, simple as well complex elements are treated uniformly.
