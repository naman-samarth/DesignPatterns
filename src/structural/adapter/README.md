# Adapter Pattern
Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

### Applicability
- when you want to use some existing class, but its interface isn’t compatible with the rest of your code.
-  when you want to reuse several existing subclasses that lack some common functionality that can’t be added to the superclass.
