# Chain of Responsibility

Lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

### Applicability
- when your program is expected to process different kinds of requests in various ways, but the exact types of requests and their sequences are
  unknown beforehand.
- when itâ€™s essential to execute several handlers in a particular order.
- when the set of handlers and their order are supposed to change at runtime
