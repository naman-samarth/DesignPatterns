# Visitor

Lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

### Applicability
- When you need to perform an operation on all elements of a complex object structure (for example, an object tree).
- To clean up the business logic of auxiliary behaviours.
- When a behavior makes sense only in some classes of a class hierarchy, but not in others.
